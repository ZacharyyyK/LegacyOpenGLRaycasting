# LegacyOpenGLRaycasting
A simple 2d ray casting 3d engine I made using legacy OpenGL in C++
Source code can be found at main.cpp, project should be set up so you can run the source code yourself with the included libraries
There's also an executable that can be run instead should the source code not work for some unforseen reason
